This repo contains the following scripts for a variety of analytics tasks:

1. igraph - templates for creating basic graphs using the "igraph" package. Can be used in conjunction with centrality measures, assortativity, etc to perform network analytics.

R Centrality measures (with graph g):
- degree(g)
- betweenness(g)
- eigen_centrality(g)

assortativity(g) - to what extent do nodes in a network associate with other nodes in the network

2. sparklyr - WIP

3. Sentiment Analysis to label text sentences as either positive or negative using the lexicon approach and machine learning approach with random forest.
